<entry key="description">A CQ package that contains all configuration information for the 'AEM training. Task 2' project.

        The config information for all environments (dev, qa, production etc.) can all be co-located in this one module
        and can then be targeted at specific environments by using the runmodes functionality in CQ. See
        http://dev.day.com/content/kb/home/cq5/CQ5SystemAdministration/RunModeDependentConfigAndInstall.html for
        further information.

        During development, the files in this module should be sync'd to your CQ instance using the FileVault command
        line tool available with CQ. There is also a plugin for Eclipse called "vaultclipse" that can be used instead
        of the command line tool.</entry>
